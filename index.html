  <h2>A Hero’s Journey</h2>
  <p>
    The hero of the series, <strong>Link</strong> is the main protagonist of 
    <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series and one of Nintendo's flagship characters. 
    A young but powerful, highly adventurous swordsman dressed in green whose 
    main objective is to protect the world from the forces of evil—generally 
    the Kingdom of Hyrule—through incredible feats of courage and bravery as 
    well as overcoming dangerous obstacles and hardships, Link made his grand
    debut in the titular first game, <em><q>The Legend of Zelda</q></em>. He has been 
    present in every subsequent title since (with the sole exception being the 
    Japan-only Satellaview games, which are non-canonical). He is one of the 
    three most important characters in the franchise, alongside Princess Zelda
    and Ganon, with the two in particular being his close ally and archenemy,
    respectively.
